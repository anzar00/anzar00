### Hi there 👋

<h2 align="center">
My name is Anzar, I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer 💻 and a part time Poet 🖋️ !
</h2>

With several years of experience in web development, I have worked on various projects ranging from simple websites to complex web applications. My expertise includes using programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks such as React and Node.js to create responsive, user-friendly, and dynamic web applications.

In addition to my technical skills, I am also an avid reader, writer and poet. I believe that creativity is just as important in code as it is in poetry, and I strive to bring that same level of imagination and originality to every project I work on.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on building a web application for a local restaurant to manage their online orders and deliveries and building an e-comerce platform for a strtup in Srinagar. I am also working for a law firm to build it's website.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use a new JavaScript framework, Vue.js, to enhance the user experience of my web applications. I'm also learning C#, .NET and Angluar to develop my skills.

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects related to web development or any project that aligns with my interests in environmental sustainability and social impact.

- 🤔 I’m looking for help with creating a more efficient workflow for my web development projects, as I am always looking for ways to improve my efficiency and productivity.

- 💬 Ask me about my experience with building RESTful APIs, my favorite web development tools and technologies, or my favorite hobby outside of coding.

- 📫 How to reach me: You can reach me by sending an email to my personal email address (peerzada.anzar@gmail.com), or by connecting with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/peerzadaanzar/">LinkedIn </a>.
