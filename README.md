### Hi there 👋

<h2 align="center">
My name is Anzar, I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer 💻 and a part time Poet 🖋️ !
</h2>

With several years of experience in web development, I have worked on various projects, ranging from simple websites to complex web applications. My expertise includes using programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks such as React and Node.js to create responsive, user-friendly, and dynamic web applications.

In addition to my technical skills, I am an avid reader, writer, and poet. I believe that creativity is just as important in code as it is in poetry, and I strive to bring that same level of imagination and originality to every project I work on.

  🔭 I’m currently working on several exciting projects, including building a web application for a local restaurant to manage their online orders and deliveries, building an e-commerce platform for a startup in Srinagar, and creating a website for a law firm.

  🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Vue.js, a new JavaScript framework, to enhance the user experience of my web applications. I am also expanding my skills by learning C#, .NET, and Angular.

  👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects related to web development or any project that aligns with my interests in environmental sustainability and social impact.

  🤔 I’m looking for help with creating a more efficient workflow for my web development projects, as I am always looking for ways to improve my efficiency and productivity.

  💬 Feel free to ask me about my experience with building RESTful APIs, my favorite web development tools and technologies, or my favorite hobby outside of coding.

  📫 You can reach me by sending an email to my personal email address (peerzada.anzar@gmail.com), or by connecting with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/peerzadaanzar/">LinkedIn </a>.

  😄 Pronouns: He/him.

  ⚡ Fun fact: I am an avid hiker and have hiked to the top of several mountains over 10,000 feet tall.

Please take a look at my GitHub repositories to see examples of my work, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or just want to chat. Let's collaborate and create something amazing together!
